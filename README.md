# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
Using python, a summary data frame was created to view the ride fares data by city type; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This allowed for a line graph of the data to be created, that visualized the results of the fares by week during the months of January – April. 

## Results
As can be seen in the graph below, across the sample amount of time there was little fluctuation in average fares within each city type. Urban grossed the most amount for the entire period, while Rurals made the least.

From the summary data frame below we can see that the average ride fare was much significantly higher in Rural, as well as average driver fare when compared to Urban. However, there is significantly less riders and drivers in these areas.

## Summary
First recommendation, would be to decrease the Rural and Suburban cost of rides, as to try and incentivize more rides taken, because in these areas drive shares are a low needed commodity due to the larger percentage of car owners. 
Second recommendation, would be to increase the Urban fare average because the lower percentage of car owners in these areas. 
Third recommendation, try to recruit more drivers in the rural and suburban areas so the drivers don’t need such high pay.
